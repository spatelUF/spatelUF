### 🌟 Highlights

- ✍️ I write about engineering & Flutter: [Blog](https://yashashm.medium.com/)
- 🎤 I give talks & workshops: [Talks](https://github.com/yashas-hm/talks)
- 🧩 I contribute to open source: [Contributions](./contributions.md)
- 🚀 I’ve shipped systems used by **10K+ users** with **99.8% uptime**
  
---

My work focuses on **shipping real products**, not demos:
- AI systems that care about **latency, reliability, and inference**
- Backend services that scale cleanly
- Mobile apps that feel fast, intentional, and human

I believe great engineering is where **architecture, performance, and product sense** meet.

### 🔍 What I work on

- **AI Systems**: RAG pipelines, LangChain, LLM integration, vector search
- **Backend Engineering**: FastAPI, Node.js, REST APIs, scalable data models
- **Mobile & Frontend**: Flutter apps with clean architecture and smooth UX
- **Infrastructure**: Dockerized deployments, CI/CD, cloud-native systems
- **Applied ML**: Computer vision, on-device ML, inference optimization

### 🎤 Outside of code

I love to dance and I am a trained classical dancer🎶
I spend my time painting and sketching 
And I love to spend time in the nature reading
